# Task-1-servo-motor
For accurate angular position control, servo motors are extensively utilized in robotics and automation.  It is madeÂ up of a motor and a position feedback sensor. To identify the intended position, a servo motor typically uses a  (PWM) signal.
# Equipment list and experiment set-up :
Arduino Uno
Servo Motor
Wires
Battery
# Experiment Procedure:
We start by connecting the battery to the Arduino Uno. After that we connect the servo motor's power wire to the 5V pin on the Arduino and then connect the signal wire to pin 9. Finally, connect the servo motor's ground wire to the GND pin on the Arduino.
